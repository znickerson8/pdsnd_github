### Project Title
Udacity Python Final Project

### Description
For the final project in the Python section of Udacity's **Programming for Data Science with Python** nanodegree, the `bikeshare.py` script was developed to provide an interactive user experience that provides summary statistics of a bikshare company in three major cities in the United States (Chicago, New York City, Washington D.C.). The user can select one city at a time on which to run analyses. First, the user is prompted to subset the data set by month or day of week, if desired. The subsetted data set is then summarized to provide the following information and statistics:

	1)	Month with the most rentals (if applicable)
	2)	Day of week with the most rentals (if applicable)
	3)	Hour with most rentals
	4)	Most common start station
	5)	Most common end station
	6)	Most common trip by start and end station
	7)	Total travel time for entire data set (hours)
	8)	Average trip duration (minutes)
	9)	Number of users by user type
	10)	Number of users by gender
	11)	Earliest year of birth for all users
	12) Most recent year of birth for all users
	13) Most common year of birth for all users
